Meeting the FOSSBox
===================

Have you heard about the "FOSSBox" and the free and open source software community on RIT's campus? [FOSS@MAGIC](http://foss.rit.edu/) is the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) program at the RIT MAGIC Center. Founded in 2009, it is an initiative created to help develop and support FOSS efforts at RIT. The community of students that meet come from a variety of majors and cross-disciplinary interests. Many students involved with the program are enrolled in the [Free and Open Source Software minor](https://www.rit.edu/news/story.php?id=50590), although many students who participate are only involved as contributors, supporters, and/or users of open source software.

The community is open and welcome to everyone in the RIT community and beyond. If you want to get more involved with the FOSS@MAGIC program, check out the following steps you can follow.


## Students
There are plenty of opportunities for students on campus to get involved with FOSS@MAGIC. Some of the following steps will help get you "bootstrapped" into the program.

### 1. Join our IRC channel.
IRC, or [Internet Relay Chat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat), is an online chat communication protocol. IRC "networks" are run by operators and anyone in the world can connect to a network. Once on a network, you can create or join a "channel" to talk with others about any topic you choose. The FOSS@MAGIC program has our own IRC channel on the [freenode](https://freenode.net/) IRC network, [#rit-foss](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=rit-foss). You can connect via webchat or you can connect with your favorite IRC client.

If you are not familiar with IRC, check out the [Beginner's Guide to IRC](https://fedoramagazine.org/beginners-guide-irc/) on the Fedora Magazine. Coming soon, we will have our own "IRC how-to" in this repository.

After idling for a while, you can request to have a [ZNC bouncer]() from [jflory7](https://github.com/jflory7) so you remain persistently connected to freenode and the channel (so you won't lose messages when you're logged out). For an overview of ZNC, read this [helpful article](https://fedoramagazine.org/never-leave-irc-znc/). To request one, send a private message to jflory7 on freenode with your contact info so he can reach out to you with more info.

### 2. Come to FOSShours.

Each week in the semester, there are planned "meetup" times where members of the FOSS community at RIT come together and meet. What we do in our weekly meetups varies. Some of us come to work on our independent studies or co-ops with professors in the program. Others come to talk about their tools, cool discoveries, and other things in the world of FOSS. Other people come to just work on homework and get help from others who might know more in the room.

At the end of the day, the community that meets is all about _sharing information_ and _meeting others_ who are also interested in FOSS, both on and off campus. If you have done work in open source, want to do work in open source, or just want to learn more about FOSS, you are welcome to attend!

Each semester, our meeting time may change. If you are unsure if the information in this repository is correct, please ask in the IRC channel.

#### Current meeting time
_Last updated for 2015-2016 academic year._

* *When*: Tuesdays and Thursdays, 4pm - 6pm
* *Where*:  GOL-2500 (conference room next to WiC headquarters)

### 3. Find a project.
Whether it's one of the countless repositories on the [FOSSRIT organization](https://github.com/FOSSRIT) or it's your own personal project, try finding an open source project to work on. If you're looking for something to work on, scroll through the repositories in the organization or ask someone in the IRC channel if they have ideas of where to look. If you have your own project, don't be afraid to share it with others and ask for feedback.
