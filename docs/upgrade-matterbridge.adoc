== Required files

Matterbridge upgrades are managed via variables in the `matterbridge` role:

* `roles/matterbridge/vars/main.yml`


== Update version and checksum

The relevant variables are below:

.roles/matterbridge/vars/main.yml
[source,yaml]
----
matterbridge_config:
  binary_checksum: "f030cae539278c8e3cf6d73d69ed8a11885aec83c73ebf6c2bd7123f14cea974"
  version: 1.16.2
----

* `binary_checksum`: Checksum value https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge/releases[provided in upstream releases]
* `version`: String of version number; should NOT include a `v` character

Update the version and checksum to the values for the new release.
